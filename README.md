 AI Real-time IoT Flood Detection System

This project is an intelligent, real-time flood detection backend powered by sensor data and AI. It supports model fusion of LSTM, CatBoost, XGBoost, and Autoencoder for robust flood prediction.

##  Features

-  Receives real-time environmental data from IoT sensors
-  Uses 4 powerful AI models (CatBoost, XGBoost, LSTM, Autoencoder)
-  Smart fusion logic for accurate flood risk prediction
-  Returns flood probability, severity class, and risk score (all as percentages)
-  Upload new CSVs to retrain all models on-the-fly
- âš™ Built with FastAPI (fully production-ready)

##  Models

| Model         | Purpose               |
|---------------|------------------------|
| CatBoost      | Binary flood prediction |
| XGBoost       | Regression for risk score |
| LSTM          | Time-series flood detection |
| Autoencoder   | Anomaly detection on environment |

##  API Endpoints

###  `POST /predict`

Send real-time sensor readings to get prediction.
